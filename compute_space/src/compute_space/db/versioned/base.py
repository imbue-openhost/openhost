"""Base classes for versioned migrations.

Transaction contract
--------------------

Each :class:`Migration` owns its own transaction. :meth:`Migration.apply`
is the public entry point the runner calls; it wraps :meth:`up` in a
single ``BEGIN EXCLUSIVE`` + version-bump + ``COMMIT`` so "migration
applied" and "schema_version bumped" are atomic.

Migration authors MUST NOT call ``db.commit()`` or issue ``BEGIN`` /
``COMMIT`` / ``ROLLBACK`` inside :meth:`up` — doing so breaks the
atomicity guarantee by ending the transaction that :meth:`apply` opened.
This rule is documented and trusted rather than enforced; we don't try
to police it.

Why ``apply`` and ``up`` are separate methods
---------------------------------------------

There are two kinds of migrations and they need transactions opened
differently:

* A Python migration runs one ``db.execute(...)`` at a time. The runner
  can safely bracket the whole sequence with an explicit
  ``db.execute("BEGIN EXCLUSIVE")`` ... ``db.execute("COMMIT")`` pair,
  and ``up()`` just emits the per-statement calls in between. That is
  what :meth:`Migration.apply` does.

* A SQL-file migration is opaque — the file may contain any number of
  statements and we do not parse it. The only built-in way to run a
  multi-statement SQL string is :meth:`sqlite3.Connection.executescript`,
  and *executescript issues an implicit* ``COMMIT`` *before running
  the script*. That implicit commit would close out a ``BEGIN EXCLUSIVE``
  the runner had opened, defeating the atomicity guarantee.

So SQL-file migrations have to embed their own ``BEGIN EXCLUSIVE`` /
``COMMIT`` *inside the string passed to executescript*. The executescript
call's implicit pre-commit hits nothing (we are in autocommit mode);
then the script itself opens, runs, and closes a transaction in one
call. That is what :meth:`SqlFileMigration.apply` does.

We used to have a hand-rolled SQL statement splitter to keep SQL files
on the Python-execute path, but custom parsers have custom bugs;
deleting it and trusting executescript is the simpler contract.

Both paths share the same outward behaviour (atomic apply + stamp), so
the runner just calls ``migration.apply(db)`` without caring which
subclass it is.

The caller of :meth:`apply` MUST open the DB in autocommit mode
(``sqlite3.connect(..., isolation_level=None)``). Python's default
isolation level wraps DML statements in implicit transactions, which
would race with our explicit ``BEGIN EXCLUSIVE``.
