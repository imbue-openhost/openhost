"""Container-runtime test helpers.

Lives in a dedicated module (not conftest.py) so integration tests that
need to tear down containers and images they spawned can import a single,
runtime-agnostic entry point.  The current implementation shells out to
podman; callers should not assume that and should only rely on the
``container_cleanup`` contract: force-remove the named container and
its built image, swallowing failures.
