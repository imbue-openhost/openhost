    This is the single acquisition entry point shared by initial setup and later domain
    addition (via /api/domains).  No-op for non-TLS domains (mDNS ``.local`` is served over
    plain http and never touches ACME).  For a TLS domain it acquires a cert only when one is
    missing or expiring, so it's safe to call repeatedly.

    Requires CoreDNS running (DNS-01) and, for a *non-primary* public domain, that the domain's
    DNS is delegated to this instance's CoreDNS (or handled by the cert_api broker) — otherwise
    acquisition can't complete.  Callers surface that failure as the domain's cert status.
