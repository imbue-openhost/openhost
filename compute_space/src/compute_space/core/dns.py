"""Manage the VM-side CoreDNS zone files.

The VM runs CoreDNS authoritative for every public domain the instance answers on
(e.g. alice.host.imbue.com plus any additional delegated domains).  Each public
domain is a separate authoritative zone with its own zone file; this module writes
and updates them.  CoreDNS watches for SOA serial changes and auto-reloads the zone
data, but a *new* zone (a new server block in the Corefile) requires a CoreDNS
restart — see ``reload_coredns_for_domains``.

For DNS-01 ACME challenges, the router calls append_txt_records() on a domain's own
zone file to add TXT records, waits for CoreDNS to pick them up, then calls
clear_txt() after the cert is issued.
