"""Periodic image pruner.

Every app rebuild re-tags ``openhost-{app}:latest`` and orphans the previous
image, so untagged (dangling) layers accumulate over time.  Nothing prunes
them automatically today: the ``/api/drop-docker-cache`` endpoint exists but
runs only on explicit operator action, so on long-lived hosts these dangling
images pile up and can fill the disk.

This module runs a lightweight daemon thread that periodically:

1. Prunes *only* dangling images (``podman image prune`` without ``--all``),
   independent of disk pressure.  Tagged images for stopped apps are kept, so
   nothing has to be rebuilt on next start — which is what makes an
   unconditional periodic prune safe.
2. Sweeps *orphaned tagged* app images: ``openhost-{name}:latest`` images whose
   app no longer exists in the DB (in any status) and which are older than
   ``image_orphan_max_age_seconds``.  App removal already deletes the app's
   image, so this only reclaims tagged images left by a removal that failed or
   predated that logic — the case a dangling-only prune can never catch
   (raised in review).  The age guard prevents reaping an image built for an
   app whose DB row is not yet committed (mid-deploy).

The interval is configured by ``image_prune_interval_seconds`` (0 disables the
thread); orphan pruning by ``image_orphan_max_age_seconds`` (0 disables it).
