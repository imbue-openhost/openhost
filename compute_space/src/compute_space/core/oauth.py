"""Router-internal OAuth token helper.

The router occasionally needs to act as an OAuth client itself — most notably to clone or pull private GitHub repos
on behalf of the operator. It does this by calling the v2 oauth service (provider app
``github.com/imbue-openhost/openhost/services/oauth``) over HTTP loopback, authenticating as a synthetic ``OPENHOST``
consumer with a hard-coded grant for the requested provider+scopes.
