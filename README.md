# Openhost

Your corner of the cloud.

Deploy, use, and share any app on a server you control. Built on the idea that open source software should be as easy to use as any other app.

[![License: AGPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

> **Early access.** Openhost is in active beta. We want you to try it and share feedback! Note that no password recovery exists yet and we don't hold keys to your instance so we can't reset it. Response time on issues and PRs may be slow as we're heads-down on the core product.



## Why Openhost

Most people have no access to the cloud that isn't mediated by a company with different incentives than theirs. Open source software exists but running it somewhere means fighting infrastructure that most people shouldn't have to touch.

Openhost is the project our team needed and couldn't find: a corner of the cloud that's genuinely yours. Where apps install as easily as on your phone, and the data lives on hardware you control.

## What people deploy

- Personal tools — AI-generated apps, scripts, and utilities that would otherwise live on localhost
- Open source software — Matrix, Minecraft servers, notes apps, project management tools
- Dev and creative tools — Sculptor, image-making software, anything you built and want to share with a real URL
- Anything Docker-compatible — add an `openhost.toml` manifest to any repo and it's deployable

## Managed hosting

If you'd rather not run your own server, [Imbue Spaces](https://openhost.imbue.com/plans) provisions one for you: your SSH key, your data, your instance. We keep no copy of your key and have no route in after provisioning.

## Quick start

### Local development

```bash
# run the router directly on your machine (needs rootless podman)
openhost up --dev

# optional: test app subdomains locally with lvh.me
# (for example: http://my-app.lvh.me:8080)
openhost up --dev --zone-domain lvh.me

# check prerequisites
openhost doctor

# stop everything
openhost down

# update code (git pull + dependency sync)
openhost update
```

### Server deployment

```bash
# full setup on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 server
ansible-playbook ansible/setup.yml -i <IP>, -e domain=<domain> -e initial_user=root \
  --private-key=~/.ssh/YOUR_SSH_KEY

# fast re-deploy (sync code + restart service)
ansible-playbook ansible/deploy.yml -i <IP>, -e domain=<domain> \
  --private-key=~/.ssh/YOUR_SSH_KEY

# verify
curl https://<domain>/health
```

See `ansible/readme.md` for prerequisites and full details.

## How it works

The router is a Python app (Quart/Hypercorn) that provides a web dashboard for deploying and managing apps. It reads `openhost.toml` manifests from app repos, builds container images from each app's `Dockerfile` using rootless podman, runs each app in its own user namespace, and reverse-proxies HTTP requests to the right app by subdomain or path prefix.

### Server mode

When deployed to a server via Ansible, the router runs as a systemd service alongside CoreDNS and Caddy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Server (Ubuntu 24.04)                      │
│                                             │
│  CoreDNS (:53)  -- ACME DNS-01 challenges   │
│  Caddy (:443)   -- TLS termination          │
│  Router (:8080) -- app mgmt + reverse proxy │
│  rootless Podman -- app containers          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

CoreDNS serves DNS for the deployment domain, enabling automatic TLS certificate acquisition via ACME DNS-01. Caddy terminates TLS on `:443` and proxies to the router on `:8080`.

All persistent data (database, TLS certs, app data) lives under `data_root_dir` (default: `/opt/openhost`).

### Dev mode

`openhost up --dev` runs the router directly on your machine: HTTP only on port 8080, no TLS, no CoreDNS, no Caddy. Requires rootless podman for running app containers.

## Cloudflare tunnel setup (no port forwarding)

For public internet access without opening home router ports. See `docs/cloudflare-local-tls-plan.md` for the full runbook and `docs/cloudflare-local-laack-xyz-setup-log.md` for a real-world setup log.

---

## Local subdomain testing (optional)

To test host-based app routing locally, run dev mode with a local zone domain:

```bash
openhost up --dev --zone-domain lvh.me
```

Then open app URLs like:

- `http://my-app.lvh.me:8080`
- `http://another-app.lvh.me:8080`

Notes:

- Optional — intended for local development only.
- The default local flow is `http://localhost:8080`.
- Port 80 is not required. If you want no port in the URL, add your own local port-forwarding from `:80` to `:8080`.

## Operating modes

| Mode | Command | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| dev | `openhost up --dev` | Runs router directly on host, HTTP only (needs rootless podman) |
| server | `ansible-playbook ansible/setup.yml` | Deploy to any VPS or bare metal with automatic HTTPS (see `ansible/readme.md`) |

---

## Components

| Component | Path | What It Does | Status |
|-----------|------|--------------|--------|
| CLI | `routerd_cli/` | `openhost` command: up, down, doctor, update | Buggy — has stale VM flags, being reworked |
| compute_space CLI | `compute_space_cli/` | Compute space management CLI | Working |
| compute_space | `compute_space/compute_space/` | HTTP routing, app deployment, auth, reverse proxy | Working |
| dau_tracker | `apps/dau_tracker/` | DAU tracking + version check | Working |
| partaay | `apps/partaay/` | Distributed event hosting | Working |

---

## Development setup

```bash
# install pre-commit hooks (requires pre-commit: pip install pre-commit)
pre-commit install
```

### [Sculptor](https://github.com/imbue-ai/sculptor) workspace setup script

Add the following in Settings → Repositories → openhost → Workspace setup command. Sculptor is Imbue's coding environment — skip this if you use a different IDE.

```bash
cp -r [YOUR_LOCAL_OPENHOST_CHECKOUT]/.idea .
pre-commit install
```

Adapt to any IDE config or other git-ignored files you'd like copied over.

---

## Testing

```bash
# run all lightweight tests (from project root)
pixi run -e dev pytest

# run with podman integration tests enabled
pixi run -e dev pytest --run-containers
```

Server deployment prerequisites and test setup are documented in `ansible/readme.md`.

## Key docs

The user-facing manual lives in `docs/src/` and is served at `https://<zone>/docs/`. No build step — edit a markdown file and reload the page to see the change.

- `docs/src/introduction.md` — introduction + table of contents
- `docs/src/creating_an_app.md` — guide to building apps
- `docs/src/manifest_spec.md` — `openhost.toml` app manifest specification
- `docs/src/routing.md` — subdomain + path routing model
- `docs/src/data.md` — persistent + archive data tiers
- `docs/src/user_identity.md` — identity / login flow for apps
- `docs/src/oauth.md` — OAuth integration with external services
- `docs/src/cross_app_services.md` — app-to-app service calls

`docs/src/SUMMARY.md` is the sidebar table of contents — add new pages there to surface them in the manual.

## Agent skill

An agent skill that gives an AI coding agent context for deploying and debugging apps on Openhost via the `oh` CLI. Install with:

```bash
npx skills add imbue-openhost/openhost --skill openhost-context
```

The skill works best with the `oh` CLI installed and logged in:

```bash
uv tool install "oh @ git+https://github.com/imbue-openhost/openhost.git#subdirectory=compute_space_cli"
oh instance login
```

Once set up, ask your coding agent to package any existing project for Openhost and deploy it directly — no manual manifest editing required.

## License

Openhost is provided under the [AGPL-3.0 license](LICENSE). Personal use is fully allowed. If the software is distributed commercially, that use must also be made open source.

We may move to a different license in the future — something like a [fair source license](https://fair.io/licenses/) — with the intent that personal use will always be unrestricted, while commercial use may be scoped to support a sustainable project. Whatever changes: personal use stays free, always.
