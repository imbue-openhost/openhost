"""Reclaim host ownership and add the startup failsafe to openhost.service.

The root-run update walk (migrations, git checkout/clean, and in older versions
``pixi install``) can leave root-owned files under the host-owned OpenHost trees
(``/home/host/openhost`` and ``/home/host/.pixi``). The host service's ``pixi
run`` then fails with EACCES and its git ops fail on root-owned objects, so it
won't start.

This migration heals such hosts and prevents recurrence:
  1. chown the trees back to host now (fixes the current host).
  2. Rewrite openhost.service to include the ``ExecStartPre=+`` reclaim step,
     so any future root-owned residue is fixed on every boot before the
     host-user ExecStart, even on hosts that can't reach an update.

Both steps are idempotent. The rewritten unit is byte-identical to the one the
baseline migration now produces (both call ``build_openhost_service_unit``).
