"""Cap journald's on-disk size so the system journal can't fill the disk.

OpenHost forwards the router process's stderr (plus forwarded Caddy and CoreDNS
output) to journald via systemd.  journald's own defaults let the journal grow
to ~10% of the filesystem (capped at 4 GB), and OpenHost previously configured
no limit — so on long-lived hosts the journal steadily grew and, combined with
accumulated container images, could fill the disk and take the instance down.

This migration installs a journald drop-in that caps total journal size at
500 MB and requests it be applied immediately.  A drop-in under
``journald.conf.d`` is used rather than editing ``/etc/systemd/journald.conf``
so we never clobber operator or distro settings, and can cleanly manage just
this one knob.

Idempotent: writing the same drop-in and re-running ``journalctl --vacuum-size``
is safe to repeat.  Kept byte-identical with the ansible task that provisions
fresh hosts (``ansible/tasks/journald.yml``); a test enforces this.
