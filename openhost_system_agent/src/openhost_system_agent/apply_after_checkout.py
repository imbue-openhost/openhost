"""Apply entrypoint: run this checkout's migrations, install deps, then
tail-call into the next ref; restart openhost once on the destination.

At each step: migrations → pixi install → checkout next ref → os.execv self.
Using execv (not a child subprocess) keeps the walk a single process no
matter how many steps the host is behind, and each step still runs that
ref's own code.

The destination is the latest release tag, unless a target ref is pinned
(git config openhost.target-ref, e.g. a feature branch) — then the tags are
still walked as stepping stones and the pinned ref is the final hop.

Migrations run before `pixi install`, so a migration that upgrades the
toolchain (e.g. pixi) takes effect before deps are installed.

There is no structured output contract: success restarts openhost (which
may kill this process — see main()), and the migration log records what
happened for the freshly-started compute_space to read. Failure is a
non-zero exit with the error on stderr.

STABILITY CONTRACT: the prior tag's update.py execs this file by path and
depends only on its exit code. Keep the path and that contract stable. Once
a new tag is cut, the contract resets to that tag's update.py.
