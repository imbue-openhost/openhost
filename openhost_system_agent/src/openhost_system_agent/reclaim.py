"""Reclaim ownership of the host's OpenHost trees.

The openhost service runs as the unprivileged ``host`` user: it invokes ``git``
and ``pixi run`` against ``/home/host/openhost`` (the repo, including its
``.pixi`` env) and against ``/home/host/.pixi`` (the pixi binary + per-user
caches). All of it must stay ``host``-owned.

The update walk runs as root, though: it applies migrations, runs
``git checkout`` / ``git clean``, and (in older versions) ran ``pixi install``
as root — all of which can leave root-owned files in these trees. The host
service then can't modify them: ``pixi run`` fails with EACCES ("Failed to
update PyPI packages ... Permission denied") and git operations fail on
root-owned objects/index. Either way the service won't start.

This module chowns those trees back to ``host`` so such a mistake self-heals
instead of bricking the host. It is a failsafe: the code paths that install
deps and update the repo already run as ``host`` where possible; this reclaims
any residue left by older buggy versions or by a stray root-run command.
